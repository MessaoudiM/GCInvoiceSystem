This project is currently in development.
The aim for this project is to develop an Invoicesystem for freelancers which will use Google Calendar & Google Contacts to populate, compute and generate invoices.
This project is under MIT license.

I will compile a list of resources I used and which I recommend:
<br><strong>1. Browserstack</strong><br>

This makes testing the webapp on multiple browsers and on multiple mobile devices a lot easier.
It uses real native testing, instead of emulating mobile devices by only adjusting screen size, which, more often than not, does not show the real output you would get.
